showdown as funct end of river?
table, table players, start wity any stack
big blind before turn..
time to act
side pots, is it a new betting round within?


ideas
tell player they have position or not to bettor, raiser

straight

you have to shift only twice max?
return no of not 5
check only once with reverse order
populate cards with same suit first
hands become classes with custom equal and greater 
on showdown we return hands in order but 2 or more could have tied? side pots..


if a player is all in you shouldnt be able to raise unless his stack is less 

also following player can have smaller stack and be able to call only part of the raise, or the CALL!

if you can raise second pot needs to be initiated if you do

if you only call no need to second pot


if all players are all in or folded no more betting, but it isn't over! need to go both streets

Over and BettingOver should be bet callbacks..


need to remove one of the same cards in a straight if they compose the straight..


do pots contain value? Return false or pots that contain value


Hand info, what players did! Should be printed for interactive player

####
fractions of pot betsizes
multiples of previous bet raises
