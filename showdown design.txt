if all players have the same stake, then we split the pot equally amongst winners

if they don't find the smaller stake and find if the won. if they didn't win, remove from staking players

repeat..


stacks should be value class  

take winning hand, and let's get all players with it. 
now lets get all the pots where they are staked. let's get all the values out of the pots, split them against the winners and put them in their stacks.
Their stack HAS to be Value() now..

now, let's see if there is any value left in any pots..if yes:

take next winning hand and repeat process
remove

be careful that the value to split is only from the pots they are both in!


need to fix straight is returning more than 5 cards if there is a pair..
